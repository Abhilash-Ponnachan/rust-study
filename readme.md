# Rust Programming - Overview
_Rust_ is a `multi paradigm systems programming language` developed at _Mozilla_ Research and open sourced under _MIT License_ and _Apache License 2.0_.  
It was originally designed by _Graydon Hoare_ with contributions added on by others including _Brendan Eich_.

It is a language designed with **safety**, **speed**, and **concurrency** as primary importance. It is a _low level langauge_ and doesn't use _Garbage Collection_, however it brings together different programming paradigms such as `procedural`, `object-oriented`, `concurrent actor`, `functional`, and `meta-programming`.

It is a modern language built on `LLVM` backend and influenced by other languages such as `C/C++`, `Lisp`, `Swift`, `Haskell`, `Erlang` to name a few.
