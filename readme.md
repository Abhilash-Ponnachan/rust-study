# Rust Programming - Overview
_Rust_ is a `multi paradigm systems programming language` developed at _Mozilla_ Research and open sourced under _MIT License_ and _Apache License 2.0_.  
It was originally designed by _Graydon Hoare_ with contributions added on by others including _Brendan Eich_.

It is a language designed with **safety**, **speed**, and **concurrency** as primary importance. It is a _low level language_ and doesn't use _Garbage Collection_, however it brings together different programming paradigms such as `procedural`, `object-oriented`, `concurrent actor`, `functional`, and `meta-programming`.

It is a modern language built on `LLVM` backend and influenced by other languages such as `C/C++`, `Lisp`, `Swift`, `Haskell`, `Erlang` to name a few.

Even though _Rust_ is a _low level language_ it has a wide range of applicability from - `command-line tools`, `embedded systems`, `WebAssembly`, `networking`, and even `web applications`.

## Installation
The standard way to install _Rust_ is using the `rustup` tool, which is an _installer_, and _version management_ tool for _Rust_.

On _Linux_ and _Mac_ we can install it from the terminal using - 
```console
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
This downloads the script file and executes it in the shell. This bootstraps the installation tool and installs the necessary components.

On _Windows_ we can download the **rustup-init.exe**, and from there it basically works the same. It will require the _C++ build tools for VS 2013 or later_ as pre-requisite.

Once complete, the process ends up installing the following components -
- `rustup` - **installation** and **version management** tool
  
    - _Rust_ has a rapid development and 6 week release cycle, so this tool is essential to manage the versions
    - To update _Rust_ simply d
    ```bash
    $ rustup update
    ```
- `rustc` - the _Rust_ **compiler**
- `cargo` - the _Rust_ **build tool** and **package manager**
    - `cargo build` - builds your project
    - `cargo run` - runs your project
    - `cargo new` - creates new project with manifest & structure
    - `cargo test` - tests the project
    - `cargo doc` - generates documentation from code
    - `cargo publish` - publishes a library to **crates.io**

All the tools are installed in the `~/.cargo/bin` directory.

## IDE
We can use any IDE or text editor to write _Rust_. In our case we shall use _VS Code_ with the plugins - 
- `Rust (rls)` - from _rust-lang_ for _code completion_, _intellisense_ etc.
- `Code Runner` - run code from within editor

## Hello World
Now that we have _Rust_ up and running let us write a simple _Hello World_ program.  

Create a new directory `hello_world` and add a new file `hello.rs`. open it in an editor and type in the following code -
```rust
// hello.rs
fn main(){
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```
Now we can compile it using -
```console
$ rustc hello.rs
```
This should produce and executable file that we can run directly from the terminal -
```console
$ ./hello
Hello World!
```
### Structure of the code
Even though the program we have written is very basic, it introduces some fundamental parts of _Rust_ code.  

Using `fn` we define a _function_ (and in _Rust_ we can write our code in outer functions directly and do not need to wrap them in _classes_ or _objects_ as in _Java_ or _C#_).  

The `main` function is a special function as it is the _Entry Point_ to the program. It is the first function to be executed when we run the compiled binary. This is similar to other languages such as _C_.  
`main` can take parameters or be empty.

All the work in our code is done by `println!`, which looks like a _function_ but is really a _macro_ (as indicated by the **!** suffix). We shall learn about _macros_ later but in simple words it is a line of code that is expanded in-place by the compiler with the code that does the actual lifting. So it is not a _sub-routine_ call to another _stack_ like a _function_. We will encounter this and more _macros_ as we go further.

## Hello Cargo
Whilst compiling with `rustc` is fine for small code bases, for real-world projects we would want to create and manage the project with the `cargo` tool.  
It is the _build system_ and _package manager_ for _Rust_ (create the project structure and manifest, manage dependencies and configure build flows). It is like `npm` for `Node.js`.

### Create a project with `cargo`
We shall create a project named `hello_cargo`. To do that go to our working directory and use `cargo` to create a new project -
```console
$ cargo new hello_cargo
     Created binary (application) `hello_cargo` package
```
This should create a new directory named `hello_cargo` with the follwing contents -
```console
./hello_cargo
    |_Cargo.toml
    |_/src
        |_main.rs
```
_It also creates a `git` repository with a `.gitignore` file if the parent directory does not already have one. It is possible to control the repository using the `--VCS <VCS>` switch. We can even specify (none)._

The tool has created a `Cargo.toml` file and a `src` directory with a `main.rs` source file.

- #### "Cargo.toml"
This is essentially the project manifest with configuration information about the project and its dependencies, like `package.json` in _NPM_. Unlike _NPM_ though _Cargo_ uses the `TOML` (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language - By Tom Preston-Werner) syntax instead of `JSON`. This kind of resembles `INI` files from back in the days, and is essentially a structured list of Key-Value pairs. Our `toml` file would look like - 
```toml
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["<name>"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
```
At this stage we do not have any dependencies, so that would be empty.

- #### "src" (directory)
Inside the `src` directory `cargo` would have created a `main.rs` file with a simple program to print _"Hello, world!"_ (exactly like what we wrote in the previous section).  

`cargo` expects all source code to exist within the `src` directory. The top-level project directory is for configuration, license and readme etc.

If we started a project without `cargo` all we have to do to convert it is to copy all the source code to and `src` sub-directory and create a `Cargo.toml` file at the top-level.

### Build with `cargo`
With the project and code in place we can use `cargo` to build it for us by using the `build` command from the project directory -
```console
$ cargo build
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (<working directory>\hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4.30s
```
This will create an executable in a `./target/debug` directory. It will also create other files such as `.pdb` for debug etc. We can run our executable from the terminal -
```console
$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo
Hello, world!
```

By default it `cargo` will build for _debug_ mode, which means it has debug symbol files and is not optimised. When the project is ready for **release** we can build with the `--release` switch/option and this will do an optimised build for release environments. The compilation/build time for **release** mode takes longer but the binary is optimised to execute faster. The **release** build would end up in the `./target/release` directory.

### Run with `cargo`
We can _build_ and _run_ the project in a single command using `run` -
```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (<working directory>\hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.36s
     Running `target\debug\hello_cargo.exe`
Hello, world!
```
We can see the code built, and the output from the executed binary.

### Check with `cargo`
`cargo` provides a way to **check** if everything is alright with our code and is good enough for _build_, without _actually creating executables_. To do this use the `check` command -

```console
$ cargo check
    Checking hello_cargo v0.1.0 (<working directory>\hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.41s
```
This does everything needed to build without actually creating the executable file, and since there is no I/O it is significantly faster. It is common practice to periodically doing a `cargo check` as we progress with coding to ensure that everything is in a _build ready_ state. 

## Basic Programming Elements
In this section we shall cover the basic programming constructs in _Rust_ that allow us to declare variable, assign values, basic data types, create functions etc.  These are the building blocks of most programming languages, and here we shall see how they are expressed in _Rust_. 

### Comments
_Rust_ has the same syntax as _C/C++_ for basic comments - 
- Line comments - start with `//`
- Block comments - enclose in `/* .. */`  
  
    - However as a convention, the _Rust community_ seems to encourage using line comments (`//`) for multi-line comments (like using `#` on comment line in _Python_).
- Documentation comments - start with `///`
    - This is used to create HTML documentation from the code using the `rustdoc` tool OR `cargo doc` command if it is a crate (the latter just runs `rustdoc` behind the scene). 
    - Documentation comments support _Markdown_ notation for formatting.

    ```rust
    // This is a single line comment
    // This is another single line comment

    /* This is a block
    - comment */

    /// ## Documentation Comments
    /// **This should generate some documentation**
    /// It supports _Markdown_ notation
    ```
    Executing the documentation tool generates HTMl documentation in the `/doc` directory.

### Variables
- #### Immutable variables
    Since _Rust_ is designed with concurrency in mind so variables are immutable by default. We can declare a variable using the `let` keyword.
    ```rust
    let x = 23;
    ```
    Now the _name_ `x` is bound to the _value_ `23`. If we try to change this the compiler will throw an error -
    ```rust
    let x = 23;
    x = 45; // this will fail at compile time
    ```
    
    ```console
    error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
    --> variables.rs:8:5
    |
    7 |     let x = 22;
    |         - first assignment to `x`
    8 |     x = 45;
    |     ^^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
    ```
- #### Mutable variables
    We can explicitly declare variables to be mutable when the need arises using the `let mut` syntax.
    ```rust
    let mut x = 21;
    x += 2; // increments x to 23
    ```

- #### Constants
    Constants like immutable variables are _names_ bound to _values_, however they are semantically different in the following ways - 
    - A constant can only be assigned a "_constant value_". I.e. it cannot be something that is computed at runtime. This is just like in `C/C++`.
    - Constants unlike variables can be assigned outside functions, and is often at _global_ or _module_ scope.
    - In _Rust_ the type of a constant has to be specified and cannot be left out to be inferred like in the case of variables.
    ```rust
    const UPPER_LIM: u32 = 100;
    let i = UPPER_LIM;
    ```
    
- #### Shadowing
    _Rust_ allows us to re-declare a variable within the same scope. This is not usually found in other statically typed languages. We can declare a variable and bind it to a value -
    ```rust
    let x = 23;
    ```
    And within the same scope we can them do something like -
    ```rust
    let x = "hello";
    ```
    Now the variable `x` is bound to a new value (`hello`) and the old instance of `x` is _shadowed_. In reality, even though we use the same variable name `x` it is in-fact a different variable with a different memory location (unlike a `mut` variable where a new _value_ is assigned to the same _address_).  
    We can clearly see how the memory address changes with shadowing - 
    
    ```rust
    let a = 2.3;
    println!("Address of a = {:p}", &a); 
    // address of variable named 'a' = 0x1dc7affba8
    
    let a = 19;
    println!("Address of a = {:p}", &a); 
    // address of a different variable named 'a' = 0x1dc7affc04
    
    let a = "alpha";
    println!("Address of a = {:p}", &a); 
    // address of yet another variable named 'a' = 0x1dc7affc58
    ```
    With a mutable variable we can see the same address after assigning a new value -
    ```rust
    let mut b = 23;
    println!("Address of b = {:p}", &b);
    // address of variable named 'b' = 0x5c74cffbc4
    
    b = 101;
    println!("Address of b after mutation = {:p}", &b);
    // address of variable named 'b' after changing value = 0x5c74cffbc4
    ```

### Basic Types
_Rust_ is a _statically typed_ language which implies that the _type_ of all variables should be known at compile time. This is in contrast to _dynamically typed_ languages such as _Python_ or _JavaScript_.  
The basic data types in _Rust_ are categorised as **Scalar types** and **Compound types**.

#### Scalar Types
A _Scalar Type_ represents a **single value**, and _Rust_ has four of these - **integers**, **floating-point numbers**, **boolean** and **characters**. This is similar to _C/C++_.

- **Integer**  
  _Integer_ type represents number values without fractional component. The different integer types in _Rust_ based on size are -  

  |  Length  |  Signed  |  Unsigned |
  |----------|----------|-----------|
  |   8-bit  |    i8    |    u8     |
  |  16-bit  |   i16    |   u16     |
  |  32-bit  |   i32    |   u32     |
  |  64-bit  |   i64    |   u64     |
  | 128-bit  |   i128   |  u128     |
  |   arch   |   isize  |  usize    |

    These integer types differ in their bit-size, and each can have a _signed_ or _unsigned_ variant.  
    If we do not specify any type the default integer type is `i32`.  
    The `arch` type automatically applies the size depending on the processor architecture word-size - 32-bit or 64-bit.  
    The range of each integer type would be -

    - for signed:  `-2^(n-1)` to `2^(n-1) - 1`  
        so for `i32` we can have values from `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647`
    - for unsigned: `0` to `(2^n)-1`  
        so for `u32` we can have values from `0` to `4,294,967,295`
    
        **Overflow**  
        If we assign a value exceeding the range of a type _Rust_ will complain and throw a _"panic" / error_ while compiling if it is in _"debug"_ mode. However if it is in _"release"_ mode it will not complain at compile time and we can get unexpected behaviour at runtime, specifically the value will wrap around (_two's complement wrapping_).

        ```rust
        let mut a: u8 = 255;
        println!("'a' initial value = {0}", a);
        // 'a' initial value = 255
        a += 1;
        println!("'a' + 1 = {0}", a);
        // debug mode - thread 'main' panicked at 'attempt to add with overflow',
        // release mode - 'a' + 1 = 0 
        ```
    
        **Formats**  
        We can represent integer literals in different formats :
        |  Format   |  Example    |
        |-----------|-------------|
        |  Decimal  | 9_123_345   |
        |  Hex      | 0xff        |
        |  Octal    | 0o77        |
        |  Binary   | 0b1101_0001 |
        |  Byte(u8) | b'A'        |

- **Floating-Point**  
For numbers with decimal points _Rust_ has two _floating-point_ types - `f32` and `f64`. |The default in _Rust_ is `f64` because in modern processors 64 operations are nearly as fast as 32 bit and gives more precision. 

    ```rust
    let b = 3.3; // f64 - default floating point type
    let c: f32 = 5.0; // f32
    ```

    **Numeric Operations**  
    _Rust_ supports the standard numeric operations such as `+`, `-`, `/`, `%`.  
    Unlike some other languages _Rust_ is very strict in type checking and **will not do implicit casting** with numeric operations if we mix up _float_ and _integer_ types.  

- **Boolean**  
A `bool` type can take either of two values `true` or `false`. It takes _1 Byte_ in memory.
```rust
let f = true;
println!("Opposite of {0} is {1}", f, !f);
//Opposite of true is false
```

- **Character**  
_Rust_ `char` data type allows us to represent characters. They are four bytes in size and uses Unicode UTF-8 encoding. Their values can range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF`. Like most other languages `char` literals are enclosed in single quotes ('').
```rust
let g = 'A';
let h = '\u{41}';   // unicode value of 'A' in Hex
let i = '\u{03A3}'; // unicode value of Greek Zigma in Hex
println!("{0}, {1}, {2}", g, h, i); 
//A, A, Σ
```
Since `char` is 4 byte data type they are different from the way we are used to dealing with them in ASCII and we shall examine later about how _String stores UTF-8 encoded text_.

#### Compound Types
A _Compound Type_ can contain/group multiple values into one. _Rust_ has two primitive _compound types_ - **Tuples** and **Arrays**

- **Tuples**  
  A _tuple_ is a grouping together of multiple values into one collection. It can group together values of _different types_. Once declared it is fixed in size and cannot grow. The values can be changed if it is declared mutable though.  
  _Tuple_ literals are declared by enclosing the values in parentheses separated by commas - 

    ```rust
    let rec = ("Alan", 1001, 75.3);
    ```
    If we wish to decalre the types of the vlaues within the declaration we can do so by specifying them in parentheses as a type for the variable - 
    ```rust
    let rec: (&'static str, i32, f32) = ("Alan", 1001, 75.3);
    ```
    _Note: the `&'static str` stands for a `slice` of `str` type with `ststic` lifetime, i.e. `string literal`._

    To access the elements of a _tuple_ we can use either the _dot syntax (.\<index>)_ OR _destructuring_.
    ```rust
    let mut rec = ("Alan", 1001, 78.6);
    // accessing the elements using .<index> and changing it
    rec.1 = 1002;
    println!("Record is {:?}", rec);
    // Record is ("Alan", 1002, 78.6)
  
    // accessing using destructuring
    let (name, _ , weight) = rec;
    println!("{0} weighs {1} Kg!", name, weight);
    // Alan weighs 78.6 Kg!
    ```
    _Note: `'_'` is a placeholder for values we don't care for while destructuring. This is same as in most other programming languages._

- **Arrays**  
    _Arrays_ in _Rust_ are homogeneous collection of items (i.e. the values are of the same type). However unlike many other languages, _arrays_ in _Rust_ are **fixed size**, so they cannot grow or shrink. 

    Arrays are declared by enclosing the values in square brackets separated by commas - 
    ```rust
    let scores = [87, 67, 48, 56, 73];
    ```
    They can have their type specified -
    ```rust
    let vow: [char; 5] = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'];
    // note type declaration uses ';'
    ```
    There is a shorthand for initialising an array if we want it to all have the same value 
    ```rust
    let base = [0; 5]
    // SAME AS - let base = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ```
    Accessing elements of an array uses the standard syntax of `'<array_name>[<index>]'` -
    ```rust
    let mut scores = [87, 67, 48, 56, 73];
    // access the first element & modify it (mut array)
    scores[0] = 92;
    // using len() method to get the length
    scores[scores.len() - 1] = 78; 
    print!("New scores are {:?}", scores);
    // New scores are [92, 67, 48, 56, 78]
    ```
    If we attempt to access and element outside the range of the array, _Rust_ will throw an _'index out of bounds..'_ error at runtime.

    The difference between a **tuple** and an **array** is the intended purpose for each. A **tuple** is menat to be used as a coumpond type for passing a set set of values around - as arguments to functions or return them. Whereas an **array* is used as an iterable collection of values.
    ```rust
    // array of scores
    let scores = [87, 67, 48, 56, 73];
    let mut sum = 0;
    // using 'for' to iterate over the array
    for i in scores.iter(){
        sum += i;
    }
    println!("Total score = {0}", sum);
    ```
### Functions
In _Rust_ functions are a fundamental unit of code. Execution starts with the special _entry point_ function `main`. Unlike many other object-oriented languages we do not need to wrap the function in a `class` or `object`.  
We declare a function using the `fn` keyword followed by the _function name_, then _parameters_ within parentheses, an optional _return type_ and finally the _body_ of the function within curly braces -

  ```rust
    // function with no parameters
    fn say_hello(){
        println!("Hola!");
    }

    // function with parameters
    fn say_hello_to(name: &str){
        // paramter type is 'str slice'
        println!("Hello {0}!", name);
    }

    // function with params & return type
    // param type = slice of array
    // return type = i32
    fn get_mean(nums: &[i32]) -> i32{
        let mut sum = 0;
        for i in nums.iter(){
            sum += i;
        }
        return sum / nums.len() as i32;
    }
  ```
_NOTE: The convention in Rust is to use `snake_case` (smaller case words separated by '\_') for function names._  
_Rust_ function names have to be unique within its scope as it does not support _function overloading_ directly.  
In the last example we could have the last line of the function as -

```rust
fn get_mean(nums: &[i32]) -> i32{
    ...
    sum / nums.len() as i32
    // Note: last line is an expression (no ;)
}
```
In _Rust_ the last expression in the function body is implicitly treated as the return value. We do not explicitly need to use the `return` keyword unless we wish to return early.

#### Statements vs Expressions
A set of instructions that can be used as the RHS of an assignment is an _Expression_, it implicitly evaluates to some value.  
A _Statement_ on the other hand is simply a set of instructions and cannot be treated like a value.  
This is a familiar concept from many other languages (such as - Ruby, Python, C#).  

```rust
    let root = {
        let r = rslt as f32;
        r.sqrt() // Note: no ;
    };
    //  'r.sqrt()' gets assigned to 'root'
    println!("Root = {0}", root);
}
```
In _Rust_ the last line of an expression should NOT have a semicolon (;), whereas statements should always end with semicolon.

### Control Flow
The basic control flow constructs are _conditional branching_ using the `if .. else` expression and _looping_ commands such as `loop`, `while` and `for`.    
- **Conditional Flow (`if..else`)**  
    The `if..else` conditional flow construct is like most other languages -
    ```rust
    if root > 5.0 {
            println!("{0} is too Big!", root);
    }
    else if root > 3.0 {
            println!("{0} seems alright.", root);
    }
    else {
            println!("{0} is too Low!", root);
    }
    ```
    In _Rust_ `if..else` is an _expression_, so we can use it for conditional assignment (lie we would use the _ternary operator_ in _C_) - 
    ```rust
    let comment = if root > 5.0 {
        "Too Big!" // Note - NO ;
    }
    else if root > 3.0 {
        "Seems alright." // Note - NO ;
    }
    else {
        "Too Low!" // Note - NO ;
    };
    // Note - expressin value should not end in semicolon
    println!("{}", comment);
    ```
- **Looping (`loop`)**  
    The `loop` keyword tells _Rust_ to keep repeating a block of code again and again (unless something causes it to `break` out of it).
    ```rust
    let mut i = 1;
    loop{
        print!("{},", i);
        i += 1;
        if i > 10 {
            break;
        }
    };
    // repeats the above block 10 times
    // 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,
    ```
    The `loop` construct can be used as an expression. It returns the value (or expression) after the `break` keyword -
    ```rust
    //loop as an expression
    let (mut i, mut sum) = (0, 0);
    let rslt = loop{
        i += 1;
        sum += i * i;
        if i > 10{
            break sum; // 'sum' is returned from the loop
        }
    };
    // 'rslt' will now have the value of 'sum'
    println!("{}", rslt);
    // 506
    ```
- **Conditional Looping (`while`)**  
    For looping based on a condition the normal construct to use is the `while` loop. This is a basic looping construct found in almost all programming languages and is the same in _Rust_ -
    
    ```rust
    let mut j = 1;
    let mut fact = 1;
    while j <= 3 {
        // executes the body as long as 
        // the condition above is true
        fact *= j;
        j += 1;
    }
    println!("Factorial = {0}", fact);
    ```
- **Looping over Iterables (`for .. in`)**  
    `for .. in` is the construct in _Rust_ that implements iteration over iterable collections -
    
    ```rust
    let scores = [67, 84, 47, 56, 78];
    let mut mean_score = 0;
    for s in &scores{ // use 'slice` or '.iter()'
        mean_score += s;
    }
    mean_score /= scores.len();
    println!("Mean score = {0}", mean_score);
    // Mean score = 66
    ```
    This approach is preferred over using `while` loops for iterating collections as it uses the collections own (intended) iteration behaviour and we do not concern with bounds and indexing etc.  
    Even for repeating code a certain number of times the idiomatic way in _Rust_ is to use `for .. in` with a _Range_ -
    
    ```rust
    let mut fact = 1;
    for i in 1..10{ // using range 1..10
        fact *= i;
    }
    println!("Factorial = {0}", fact);
    // Factorial = 362880
    ```
## "Ownership" in Rust
_Rust_ provides memory management without a _garbage collector_ (unlike .Net or Java). Its **"ownership"** mechanism enables it to be deterministic about variable lifetimes and therefore make **"memory safety guarantees"**.

- **Ownership**  
  All language runtime have to manage the memory they use at runtime, and they take different approaches to do this.  

    - Some of them rely on _generational garbage collection_ (_GC_) that periodically looks for and cleans up unused memory - _'.Net'_, _'Java'_ for example.  
    - Another approach is _automatic reference counting_ (_ARC_) that tries to keep track of all the references to an allocation and removes it when that count reaches zero - this is the approach taken by _'Swift'_  
    - Yet other languages put the onus on the programmer to allocate and free up memory - this is the model in _'C'_.  

    _Rust_ does not take dynamic memory deallocation approach like _GC_ or _ARC_, it is actually "similar" to the _manual_ model of _C_ that have code to explicitly deallocate heap objects. The difference is that in _Rust_ the compiler is capable of injecting that deallocation into the code at compile time. This is possible because its strict "ownership" model, which makes the lifetime of objects in memory deterministic at compile time.  
    _Rust_ keeps track of which part of code is using what data on the _Heap_, minimising the amount of duplicate data on the _Heap_, and cleaning up unused data.  It takes a similar approach to _Heap_ memory as it does with _Stack_, in that as soon as the _"Owner"_ of the memory goes out of scope it can claim the memory back.

- **Rules of "Ownership"**  
    "Ownership" in _Rust_ is based on 3 simple rules -
        - Each **value** has a variable that is called its **owner**
        - There can only be **one owner** at a time
        - When the **owner** goes out of **scope** the **value** will be **dropped**

        _Note: Rust is "block scoped"_ -
        
        ```rust
        {
            let x = "Hello"; // x scope starts
            ... // x is valid here
        } // x goes out of scope here
        ```
    
    In order to illustrate the behaviour of _ownership_ we need a more complex data type than the simple _scalar_ types as they are allocated on the **stack** since they have limited ad predetermined size. _string literals_ will not do either as they are compiled into the binary and have known fixed size.  
    We need a data type that needs _allocation_ on the **heap** such as the **String** type. Unlike _string literals_ the `String` types is able to store a varying amount of text (i.e. it can grow or shrink). Whilst there is a lot to be said of `String`, for our purposes now we shall limit ourselves to aspects that are relevant to memory management.
    
    Two convenient ways to create a string is using its static methods `new` and `from`, as shown below -
    ```rust
    let x = String::new(); // empty String
    println!("Value of x = {}", x);
    // Value of x = 

    let y = String::from("Hola"); // from string literal
    println!("Value of y = {}", y);
    // Value of y = Hola
    ```

    `Srtring` gives us methods to modify the text in place -

    ```rust
    let mut y = String::from("Hola");
    println!("Value of y = {}", y);
    // Value of y = Hola

    y.push_str(" amigo!");
    println!("Value of y = {}", y);
    // Value of y = Hola amigo!
    ```

    _Note: How we now have to make the variable `y` 'mutable'_

    When we need to allocate memory on the _Heap_ we must request it from the **OS**, and we do that when we call `String::from`. When the variable that _owns_ the data in this memory (the variable `y` in our case) goes out of scope _Rust_ injects a method call to a method called `drop`. This is similar to `destructor` in _C++_, the writer of `String` can have cleanup code here. _Rust_ will ensure this method gets called automatically when "ownership" ends.
        
    _Note: In C++ this pattern of cleaning up resources at the end of an object's lifetime is called **RAII** or 'Resource Acquisition Is Initialisation'_.  
  
- **Variable assignment - "Move or Copy"**  
  We saw that when the variable that is bound to the data goes out of scope the memory for that data is freed. What happens if there are more than one variable bound to the data? Let us see how this might work with the following setup -

  - Assign an `i32` to a variable `a`
  - Re-assign the data to another variable `b`
  - Pass 'b' to a custom function `show` to print it to _std I/O_
    
    - _there is a reason why we are using this function. It helps simulate ownership transfer situation, as we shall see as we proceed._
  
- Finally call `show` on the original variable `a` again
  
    ```rust
    // "copy" semantics
    fn main() {
        let a: i32 = 23;
        // assign 'a' to 'b'
        let b = a;
        show(b);    // 23
        // now show 'a'
        show(a);    // 23
    }
    // custom function to print value
    fn show<A: std::fmt::Display>(p: A){
        println!("{}", p);
    }
  ```
  
    So far so good, now let us try to do this with a `String` data type instead of `i32` - 
    ```rust
    // "move" semantics
    fn main() {
        let a: String = String::from("hello");
        // assign 'a' to 'b'
        let b = a;
        show(b);    // hello
        
        // now show 'a'
        show(a);    // Error!
    }
    /*
    error[E0382]: use of moved value: `a`
    --> src/main.rs:8:10
    |
    2 |     let a: String = String::from("hello");
    |         - move occurs because `a` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
    3 |     // assign 'a' to 'b'
    4 |     let b = a;
    |             - value moved here
    ...
    8 |     show(a);    // 23
    |          ^ value used here after move
    */
    ```
  We get an error, the compiler is panics and and is trying to tell us that we are trying to use the variable `a` after the data has been **moved**, and the "move" occurred at `let b = a`. It goes on to explain that the "move" happened because `String` does not implement the `Copy` trait.
  
  So as we can see the compiler error is quite descriptive and goes it great detail explaining the scenario. This is one of _Rust's_ philosophy and even though it is quite strict it can be a helpful friend.
  
  - So what happened here is that with `String` (unlike the `i32` value) since the data is allocated on the _Heap_ when a new variable points to the same data, the ownership gets transferred to the new variable and the old variable is no longer associated with the data value and when we attempt to use the invalidated variable _Rust_ will trow an error.
  
  - Since there is only one owner (`b` in this case) _Rust_ can make a deterministic `free` of the data it points to in memory when `b` goes out of scope (or end of its lifetime).
  
    - In the case of the `i32` it was a simple data type with a fixed size known at compile time and therefore their data is placed on the _Stack_. When we assign it to a new variable _Rust_ makes a **copy** of that data in memory and binds the new variable with that, leaving the old data and variable in tact. When the function call associated with the _Stack_ is complete the _Stack_ frame is removed with all the data in it.
    - With dynamic data such as `String` we cannot use the _Stack_, they are allocated on the _Heap_. Allocation and deallocation on the _Heap_ is expensive and can become a significant performance bottleneck. _Rust_ does not implicitly create _deep copies_. 
    - So the approach _Rust_ has taken to memory management on the _Heap_ is to **move** ownership whenever some data on the _Heap_ is assigned to another variable or passed to some function as an argument (in the later case the function parameter gets the **ownership**).
  - The mechanism that is used the language level is the `Copy` **trait** (a _trait_ is like an interface, we shall learn more about them later). Simple scalar types such as Integer, Float, Double, Boolean, Character and Tuples of these can be placed on the _Stack_, and they have the `Copy` trait. That way when another variable/parameter needs them it gets a copy of the data (similar to _"Pass by Value"_ in _C++_). We can have our custom types implement types implement the `Copy` trait, and then _Rust_ will treat it with the **copy semantics** just like it does for the builtin scalar types. However if our type has the `Drop` trait, then it will not allow us to implement the `Copy` trait on that type. As we have seen `drop` is for cleanup behaviour when the owner goes out of scope. It does not make sense to have both traits.
  
- **Variable assignment - "Clone"**  
    If we do want to create a deep copy of the data on the _Heap_, we can do that for objects that support the `clone` method.
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let a: String = String::from("hello");
        // clone 'a' to 'b'
        let b = a.clone();
        show(b);    // hello
        
        // now show 'a'
        show(a);    // hello
    }
    ```
    Here `b` gets a **cloned** copy of the string `hello` and it leaves `a` intact with individual ownership to the separate data copies in memory. 

- **Function calls and Ownership**  
  **Ownership** and memory management comes into concern not only during _variable assignment_, the same semantics apply when we invoke functions passing the data around.

  - **Passing data to a Function**
    Passing a variable to a function call as an argument will result in an **ownership move or copy**, depending on the data type (just like assigning to a variable). In this case it is technically an assignment to the function's formal parameter. We can demonstrate that in our code snippet with a small rearrangement -
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let a: i32 = 23;
        
        // call a function with 'a' as argument
        show(a);    // hello
        
        // now assign 'a' to 'b'
        let b = a; // 23
    }
    ```
    Passing an `i32` as argument to a function results in a **copy**.

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let a: String = String::from("hello");
        
        // calls a function with 'a' as argument
        show(a);    // hello
        
        // now assign 'a' to 'b'
        let b = a; // Error!
    }
    /*
    error[E0382]: use of moved value: `a`
     --> src/main.rs:8:13
      |
    2 |     let a: String = String::from("hello");
      |         - move occurs because `a` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
    ...
    5 |     show(a);    // hello
      |          - value moved here
    ...
    8 |     let b = a; // Error!
      |             ^ value used here after move
    */
    ```

    Passing a `String` (_Heap_) data as argument to a function, and then trying to use that same variable again results in the same `E0382` error. This is because, with the function call the **ownership** of the `String` data has **moved** to the function's parameter (`p: A` in our case).

  - **Returning data from a Function**
    Returning a value from a function can also transfer **ownership**. If the return value from a function is assigned to a variable, then that variable gets the **ownership** of that data. The lifetime of the data will now be extended beyond the scope of the function. Return can be used to take back **ownership** of data passed to a function. We can modify our previous code snippet to work correctly using this technique-

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        // make the variable mutable
        let mut a: String = String::from("hello");
        
        // calls a function with 'a' as argument
        // and assign teh return back to the original variable
        a = show(a);    // hello
        
        // now assign 'a' to 'b'
        let b = a; // now it works!
    }
    
    fn show<A: std::fmt::Display>(p: A) -> A{
        println!("{}", p);
        p // returning the parameter value
    }
    ```
    Now when we use the variable `a` after passing it to the `show` function it works without giving an error. This is because in this case the function `show` returns the value it received as parameter back to the caller which gets assigned again to the same variable (`a`). However to make this work we had to do quite a bit of jugglery -

    - The variable `a` has to be made _mutable_ with the `mut` keyword, so that it can be reassigned with the return from the function `show`.
    - We have to make the function invocation into an expression on the _RHS_ of an assignment.
    - The function `show` itself has to be modified to have a return type (`-> A`).
    - The value of the parameter `p` has to to be returned from the function (as the last line of the function without a `;`)

    Setting up the code in this way to take back ownership can get complicated, neither is it always practical. Next we shall see better way to do this **References** and **Borrowing**.

- **References**

    The problem with passing our `String` variable as an argument to the `show` function is that when we do that the function parameter `p` gets **ownership** of the data value pointed by the variable. After that if we try to use the 	original variable _Rust_ will complain. So we need a mechanism to pass/assign a variable without transferring **ownership**. This is what **references** allow us to do. We represent a **reference** by prefixing the variable/argument with **`&`**. Let us modify our code listing to work with a **reference** and see how it works -

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let a: String = String::from("hello");
        
        // borrow a reference to 'a'
        show(&a);    // hello
        
        // now assign 'a' to 'b'
        let b = a; // 'a' is still available
    }
    
    fn show<A: std::fmt::Display>(p: &A){
        // 'p' has a reference to the value
        // but no ownership
        println!("{}", p);
    }
    ```

    The changes we made are:

    - When we invoke the function we pass in a **reference** to the variable instead of the variable (`show(&a)`)
    - The function definition itself has a modification in the parameter type, the parameter is defined as a **reference** type (`p: &A`)

    With this change the original variable `a` still retains the **ownership** while the parameter `p` can get a reference to the value that it can use as `read-only`.

    A **reference** unlike **raw pointer** enforces certain rules about referencing/borrowing that help avoid inadvertent mutations to the value. 

    To see this let us try to setup a function that tries to modify our string using a **borrow** - 

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        // declare and init a String variable 
        let a = String::from("Alpha");
        
        // pass 'a' as reference to the function
        change_str(&a); // Error
        
        println!("{}", a); 
        
        
    }
    
    // specify the parameter as reference to String
    fn change_str(text: &String){
        text.push_str(" Beta!");
    }
    
    /*
    Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
    error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*text` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
      --> src/main.rs:15:5
       |
    14 | fn change_str(text: &String){
       |                     ------- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `&mut std::string::String`
    15 |     text.push_str(" Beta!");
       |     ^^^^ `text` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
    */
    ```

    The compiler complains that the data cannot be borrowed as **"mutable"** because it is behind a **normal reference**.

    If we need to modify a value it is possible to get a **mutable reference**   by prefixing it with the **`mut`** keyword, as shown -

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        // declare the variable as mutable
        let mut a = String::from("Alpha");
        
        // borrow 'a' as a 'mutable reference' (&mut)
        change_str(&mut a);
        
        println!("{}", a); // Alpha Beta!
        
        
    }
    
    // specify the parameter type as 'mutable reference' (&mut)
    fn change_str(text: &mut String){
        text.push_str(" Beta!");
    }
    ```

    Now we are able to change the data via the **mutable reference**, and in order to achieve that we had to do a few things explicitly -

    	- Declare the variable `a` as mutable
    	- Borrow as **mutable reference** using `&mut` when calling the function
    	- Define the function parameter as **mutable reference** (`&mut String`)

    As we can see trying to do state mutation requires us to make it explicit in the code and at all points that might impact it.

    Even though we can obtain **mutable references** there are certain restrictions imposed that prevent us from resulting in **concurrency errors** (such as **race conditions** and **dead locks**).

    - One restriction is that we can have only one active **mutable reference** at a time in the same scope. For example we could try to get two mutable references as below -

      ```rust
      fn main() {
          // declare and init a String variable 
          let mut a = String::from("Alpha");
          
          // get two mutable references
          let r1 = &mut a;
          let r2 = &mut a;   
      }
      ```

      So far it seems _Rust_ has allowed us to get two **mutable references**, however if we modify the code slightly to try and use the earlier **reference** we will get a compile time error -

      ```rust
      fn main() {
          // declare and init a String variable 
          let mut a = String::from("Alpha");
          
          // get two mutable references
          let r1 = &mut a;
          let r2 = &mut a;
          
          // Try to print (use) 1st refernce
          println!("r1 = {}", r1); // Error!
      }
      /*
      error[E0499]: cannot borrow `a` as mutable more than once at a time
        --> src/main.rs:7:14
         |
      6  |     let r1 = &mut a;
         |              ------ first mutable borrow occurs here
      7  |     let r2 = &mut a;
         |              ^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
      ...
      10 |     println!("r1 = {}", r1); // Error!
         |                         -- first borrow later used here
      */
      ```

      This way we cannot end up inadvertently modifying the same data from two places.

    - Another restriction is that we cannot have a **mutable reference** while holding active **immutable references**. This make sense as the code that uses the **immutable references** would not expect the data to be modified inadvertently, which could happen if you can have active **mutable reference** at the same time. We can see that _Rust_ will give an error if we try -

      ```rust
      fn main() {
          // declare and init a String variable 
          let mut a = String::from("Alpha");
          
          // get an immutable reference 
          let r1 = &a;
          
          // get a mutable reference 
          let r2 = &mut a;
          
          // Try to print (use) 1st refernce
          println!("r1 = {}", r1); // Error!
      }
      /*
      error[E0502]: cannot borrow `a` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
        --> src/main.rs:9:14
         |
      6  |     let r1 = &a;
         |              -- immutable borrow occurs here
      ...
      9  |     let r2 = &mut a;
         |              ^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
      ...
      12 |     println!("r1 = {}", r1); // Error!
         |                         -- immutable borrow later used here
      */
      ```

    - The third restriction is that **references must be valid**. In languages like _C/C++_ which allow manipulating raw pointers, it is possible to have **dangling pointers**, or pointers to deallocated or invalid memory locations. _Rust_ on the other hand ensure that it does not end up with **dangling pointers/references**, by making sure that the **data** will not go out of scope before the **reference** goes out of scope. It is a simple but effective approach.

      We can try to simulate this with a function that creates a string and returns a **reference** to it -

      ```rust
      fn main() {
      
          let x = dangling_ref();
          
          // Try to print 'x'
          println!("x = {}", x); // Error!
      }
      
      
      fn dangling_ref() -> &String{
          // initialize a local string data
          let s = String::from("Hello");
          // return reference to it
          &s
      }
      /*

        --> src/main.rs:10:22

      ```

      The function returns a **borrowed reference** to `s` which is a local variable, bu that goes out of scope once the function is over, so there is nothing to **refer** to for the returned **reference**. _Rust_ preemptively stops us from doing such things.

      If we did want to return a value from the function we can return it as a **value with ownership**, in which case the **ownership** gets transferred to the variable outside the function -

      ```rust
      fn main() {
      
          let x = not_dangling_ref();
          
          // Try to print 'x'
          println!("x = {}", x); // x = Hello
      }
      
      
      fn not_dangling_ref() -> String{
          // initialize a local string data
          let s = String::from("Hello");
          // return value with ownership
          s
      }
      ```

      Now `x` will have **ownership** of the `String` data `Hello`.

    To summarise the **rules of reference** are:

    - At a given time we can have only **one mutable reference** or any number of **immutable references**. We cannot have more that one **mutable reference** or combine **immutable references** with **mutable** ones.
    - A **reference** must always point to **valid data**

- **Slices**

    Another form of reference/data type that does NOT have ownership is **slices**. They come into picture when working with collections (especially strings). A **slice** is a reference to a **contiguous range** within a **collection** rather than the whole collection. So whilst a normal _string reference_ (`&String`) is a **reference** to the whole `String` data, a _string slice_ (`&str`) is a **reference** to a specific range of the string data. We can see a few examples of how to specify slices, and how the _range start and end specifiers_ behave (it is very similar to other languages such as `Python`).
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
    
        let s = String::from("Hello World!");
        
        // string slice from 0 to 5 chars
        let s1 = &s[0..5];
        println!("{:?}", s1);// Hello
        
        // starting from 0 can omit 0
        let s2 = &s[..5];
        println!("{:?}", s2);// Hello
        
        // ending in len can omit the range-end
        let s3 = &s[6..];
        println!("{:?}", s3);// World!
    
        // range-end specifier is end-index + 1
        // so to get 6th char to 3 chars after 6th
        let s4 = &s[6..6+3]; // &s[6..9]
        println!("{:?}", s4);// Wor
    }
    ```
    
    Typically when we pass _strings_ or _vectors_ around (or return them from functions), we tend to use **slices**. This way we do not transfer **ownership** and also we get a more _flexible reference_ to the underlying data. Let us look at an example that can return the first word of a string text -
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
    
        let s = String::from("Hello World!");
        
        let f = first_word(&s);
        println!("first word in {} = '{}'", s, f);
        // first word in Hello World! = 'Hello'
    
    }
    
    fn first_word(text: &String) -> &str{ // returns string slice
       // access underlying String bytes
       let bytes = text.as_bytes();
       // iterate through the bytes and check for space
       // destructure iterator item to index=i and ref to item=&byt
       for (i, &byt) in bytes.iter().enumerate(){
           if byt == b' ' {
            // return slice till 'i'
               return &text[..i]
           }
       }
       
       // if reached here return full string as slice
       &text[..]
    }
    ```
    
    Our function `first_word` returns a **slice** of the `String` passed in. Under the hood this is just a _memory safe pointer_ to part of the `String` data. They follow the same rules of **borrowing** as regular references. So for example if in the above example we tried to modify the original `String` _Rust_ will prevent us -
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
    
        let mut s = String::from("Hello World!");
        
        let f = first_word(&s);
        
        // try clearing the string here
        s.clear(); // Error - cannot do mutable borrow
        
        println!("first word in {} = '{}'", s, f);
        // first word in Hello World! = 'Hello'
    
    }
    /*
    error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
     --> src/main.rs:7:5
      |
    5 |     let f = first_word(&s);
      |                        -- immutable borrow occurs here
    6 |     
    7 |     s.clear();
      |     ^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
    8 |     
    9 |     println!("first word in {} = '{}'", s, f);
      |                                            - immutable borrow later used here
    */
    ```
    
    Here we tried to clear(empty) the `String` '`s`' after we returned it to the variable '`f`' (which is an immutable **slice** to the `String` data '`s`'). Further more we are using this **immutable** borrow **slice** '`f`' in the `println!` macro later. If this is allowed, then _Rust_ cannot ensure data integrity (or memory safety). If we are not using '`f`' (the **slice**)  then it is fine and we are allowed to mutate the original `String 's'`.
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
    
        let mut s = String::from("Hello World!");
        
        let f = first_word(&s);
        
        // try clearing the string here
        s.clear(); // this works now
        
        // we are not refering to 'f' later
        
        println!("now the String is '{}'", s); 
        // now the String is ''
    }
    ```
    
    Though _Rust_ will give a _warning_ that the "variable 'f' is unused".
    
    **Mutable Slices >>** 
    
    Like regular **references** , **slices** can also be mutable. In fact we can use a **mutable slice** to examine how it relates to the original collection. If we modify our code example to return a **mutable slice**, we can see that modifying the **slice** modifies the **original String** -
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
    
        let mut s = String::from("Hello World!");
        
        let f = first_word(&mut s);
        println!("The slice 'f' is '{}'", f);
        //The slice 'f' is 'Hello'
        
        // then modify the mutable slice to be uppercase
        f.make_ascii_uppercase();
        
        println!("Now the original String is '{}'", s);
        // Now the original String is 'HELLO World!'
    
    }
    
    fn first_word(text: &mut String) -> &mut str{ // returns mutable string slice
       // access underlying String bytes
       let bytes = text.as_bytes();
       // iterate through the bytes and check for space
       // destructure iterator item to index=i and ref to item=&byt
       for (i, &byt) in bytes.iter().enumerate(){
           if byt == b' ' {
            // return slice till 'i'
               return &mut text[..i]
           }
       }
       
       // if reached here return full string as slice
       &mut text[..]
    }
    ```
    
    Of course everything is still consistent with the rules of **borrowing**, for example if we tried to do another **mutable borrow** in the same scope we would get an error-
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
    
        let mut s = String::from("Hello World!");
        
        let f = first_word(&mut s);
        println!("The slice 'f' is '{}'", f);
        //The slice 'f' is 'Hello'
        
        // try to get another mutabel slice
        let g = first_word(&mut s); // Error!
        
        // then modify the mutable slice to be uppercase
        f.make_ascii_uppercase();
        
        println!("Now the original String is '{}'", s);
        // Now the original String is 'HELLO World!'
    
    }
    /*
    error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
      --> src/main.rs:9:24
       |
    5  |     let f = first_word(&mut s);
       |                        ------ first mutable borrow occurs here
    ...
    9  |     let g = first_word(&mut s);
       |                        ^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
    ...
    12 |     f.make_ascii_uppercase();
       |     - first borrow later used here
    */
    ```
    
    So **slices** give us the flexibility to work with collections/string whilst ensuring memory safety and helping us avoid situations in code that can lead to data related inconsistencies. It is the idiomatic way to work with strings in _Rust_. 
    
    **String Literals >>**
    
    In fact **string literals** in _Rust_ are accessed as **slices**. For optimisation reasons _Rust_ embeds **string literals** into the binary an **immutable slice** reference to it within the code. 
    
    ```rust
    let a = "This is a string literal";
    
    let b = a;
    ```
    
    In the above code snippet the variable '`a`' is of the type `&str` (an **immutable string slice**) and when we assign that variable '`b`', it's type too will be `&str`. Now both the **slices** will point to the same embedded character sequence in the binary (which the underlying memory representation for string literals).
    
    This means that in general, experienced _Rust_ developers would use **string slice** instead of **String reference** as parameter/return types. This gives the flexibility to borrow from `String` or _string literals_. We would write our now familiar example as -
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
    
        let s = String::from("Alpha Centauri");
        
        let f = first_word(&s);// takes String
        println!("{}", f);
        // Alpha
        
        let g = first_word("Beta Centauri"); // takes string literal
        println!("{}", g);
        // Beta
    }
    
    // accept &str
    fn first_word(text: &str) -> &str{ // returns string slice
       // access underlying String bytes
       let bytes = text.as_bytes();
       // iterate through the bytes and check for space
       // destructure iterator item to index=i and ref to item=&byt
       for (i, &byt) in bytes.iter().enumerate(){
           if byt == b' ' {
            // return slice till 'i'
               return &text[..i]
           }
       }
       
       // if reached here return full string as slice
       &text[..]
    }
    ```
    
    **Slices to other Data-Types >>**
    
    Whilst **slices** are very natural for `String` data, we can have **slices** to any data-type in general. If we wish to refer to/deal with part of an integer vector we could have a **slice** to that -
    
    ```rust
     // an array of numbers (i32)
    let nums = [3, 2, 4, 1, 6, 5, 9];
    
    // a slice of the i32 array or (&[i32])
    let sn = &nums[..3];
    println!("{:?}", sn); // [3, 2, 4]
    ```
    
    Here the type of the variable '`sn`' is **`&[i32]`**. This the general type representation for a **slice**. Even for a **string slice** the representation of **`&str`** is just syntactic sugar for **`&[string]`**.
    
    If we wanted to write a function to take an integer array and return the sum, we would do something like -
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        
        // an array of numbers (i32)
        let nums = [3, 2, 4, 1, 6, 5, 9];
        
        // sum of whole array
        let t1 = sum_nums(&nums[..]);
        println!("Sum = {}", t1); // Sum = 30
        
        // sum of half the array
        let t2 = sum_nums(&nums[..nums.len()/2]);
        println!("Sum = {}", t2); // Sum = 9
    }
    
    // fn accepts a slice of an array of i32
    fn sum_nums(ns: &[i32]) -> i32{
        let mut s = 0;
        for i in ns{
            s += i;
        }
        s
    }
    ```
    
    Since our function accepts a **slice** of `i32` array, we can pass in parts of the original array/vector. In the same way we can have **slice** to collections of any any other data-types (even user defined data types).
    
    With a good understanding of **memory handling**, **references**, **borrowing**, and **slices** we can try to write a nontrivial piece of code, by implementing an _in-place quicksort algorithm_  -
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        
        // an array of numbers (i32)
        let mut nums = [3, 2, 4, 1, 6, 5, 9];
        //let mut nums = [2, 4, 6, 3, 1, 5];
        //let mut nums = [2, 1];
        
        // call 'qsort' with a mutable reference
        qsort(&mut nums);
        println!("{:?}", nums);
        // sorted array 
    }
    
    // in-place quicksort, takes a mutable slice of i32
    fn qsort(ns: &mut [i32]){
        let l = ns.len();
        if l > 1{
            let mut pi = 0; // find pivot
            let mut si = pi + 1;
            while si < l {
                // scan from pivot and find smaller elements
                if ns[si] < ns[pi]{
                    let t = ns[si];
                    let mut j = si;
                    // shift from pivot right by 1
                    while j > pi{
                        ns[j] = ns[j-1];
                        j -= 1;
                    }
                    // swap smaller to pivot
                    ns[pi] = t;
                    pi += 1;
                }
                si += 1;
            }
            // recursive quicksort left and right of pivot
            qsort(&mut ns[..pi]); // qsort the left (smaller) side
            qsort(&mut ns[pi+1..]); // qsort the right (greater) side
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
    The algorithm itself is just a standard _quick-sort_ algorithm using recursive calls, however the interesting thing from a _Rust_ perspective is how we declare the parameter as a **mutable slice** (`&mut i32`) and we make **mutable borrows**.
    
    Next set to explore how to define and operate with custom data-types.

## Custom Data-Types

In _Rust_ **Structs** and **Enums** are the building blocks for creating our own "custom-types" in our program domain. They are respectively the **product** and **sum** _algebraic data types (ADTs)_ in _Rust_.

### Structs

A **struct** (or **structure**) is a data-type that allows us to package together multiple data elements together into one named type. An instance of a **struct** will be a composite of **"all"** its individual elements (or members) - I.e. it is a **product data-type**. _(the cardinality of a **struct** type will be the product of the cardinality of all its member types)_. **Structs** is a familiar programming concept in other classical language such as _Pascal_ and _C_.

Another **product type** we have already seen is the **tuple** type. Unlike a **tuple** though the members of a **struct** and defined and accessed with _associative names_ and not their position. This makes **structs** more flexible and natural to model domain types.

#### Defining Structs

We can define a **struct** using the `struct` keyword followed by the _name_ and then its members with data types separated by commas -

```rust
struct User{
    user_id: String,
    email_id: String,
    logged_in: bool
}
```

Here we have defined a **structure** to represent a `User`. _Note: how the members/fields of the structure have names with 'Snake_Case', this is the recommended style in Rust and in fact the compiler will give us a warning if we don't follow it._

#### Instantiating Structs

When we need instances of the **struct** we can create them using the **name** of the **struct** followed by the fields and concrete values for each _(Note that there is no `new` keyword like we use for classes in say C++/C#/Java. In that regard this is more similar to Kotlin in syntax)._ Also note that the actual order of the fields does not matter -

```rust
let u1 = User{
    email_id: String::from("albert.einstein@acme.com"),
    logged_in: false,
    user_id: String::from("R1002")
};
```

Note how the syntax for instantiating a **struct** is very similar to defining it (we even use the `:` to separate the name and the value). We simply specify the **value** instead of the **type** of the field.

> Note how in the **struct** `User` we specify the type of the fields `email_id` and `user_id` as owned type `String` instead of the slice type `&str`. This is because the instance of the **struct** should **"own all its data"** and for that data to be valid for as long as the **struct instance** is valid.
>
> It is possible to use **references** and **slices** as field types, but that will need the use of _**lifetime specifiers**_ that can ensure that the data referenced is valid as long as the **struct instance** is valid.
>
> We shall revisit this once we learn about **lifetime** later.

#### Accessing Members

We access **struct fields** using the "dot notation" (`<instance_name>.<field_name>`) syntax just like most other languages.

```rust
let u1 = User{
    email_id: String::from("albert.einstein@acme.com"),
    logged_in: false,
    user_id: String::from("R1002")
};
// access 'u1' fields using '.'
println!("User {} is {}loggedin.", u1.user_id, if !u1.logged_in {"Not "} else {""});
// User R1002 is Not loggedin.
```

#### Mutable Structs

If we want to change the value of a field after it is crated we can do that by making the **struct** _**mutable**_. Note that we can only make the whole **struct** mutable (or not), we cannot make individual fields mutable (which makes sense if we want deterministic control on that behaviour) -

```rust
let mut u1 = User{
    email_id: String::from("albert.einstein@acme.com"),
    logged_in: false,
    user_id: String::from("R1002")
};
// change the 'logged_in' status
u1.logged_in = true;
println!("User {} is {}loggedin.", u1.user_id, if !u1.logged_in {"Not "} else {""});
// User R1002 is loggedin.
```

Now we have a **mutable struct** and we can change the value of `logged_in` to `true`.

#### Field Init Shorthand Syntax

Specifying the name and the value for each field can get quite verbose and tedious. Luckily _Rust_ provides a shortcut syntax to specify the fields using variables(or function parameters) directly as long as the variable/parameter identifiers have the same name as the fields -

```rust
// varibales have same name as struct feilds
let email_id = String::from("albert.einstein@acme.com");
let user_id = String::from("R1002");
let logged_in = false;

let mut u1 = User{
    email_id,
    logged_in,
    user_id
};
```

This is especially handy with functions that create **structs** with passed in values -

```rust
fn main() {
	// call function to get User instance
    let mut u1 = get_user(String::from("albert.einstein@acme.com")
                        , String::from("R1002"));
    
    u1.logged_in = true;
    println!("User {} is {}loggedin.", u1.user_id, if !u1.logged_in {"Not "} else {""});
    // User R1002 is loggedin.
}

// function parameters have same name as struct feilds
fn get_user(email_id: String, user_id: String) -> User{
    User{
        email_id,
        user_id,
        // we can even combine with explicit field name 
        logged_in: false
    }
}
```

#### Struct Update Syntax - Instances from other Instances

If we want to create a **struct** instance using values of another instance we might try something like -

```Rust
fn main() {
    // declare first istance c1 of car
    let c1 = Car{
                make: String::from("Ford"),
                plate: String::from("CA 2341"),
                year: 2014
            };
    
    // create c2 with values of c1
    let c2 = Car{
        		// use c1 values individually
                make: c1.make,
                year: c1.year,
                plate: String::from("TX G023"),
            };   
}
// struct for car
struct Car{
    make: String,
    plate: String,
    year: u16
}

```

Again _Rust_ provides some syntactic sugar to make this type of declarations easier (using the **struct update syntax** `..`) -

```rust
fn main() {
    let c1 = Car{
                make: String::from("Ford"),
                plate: String::from("CA 2341"),
                year: 2014
            };
    
    // create c2 with values of c1
    let c2 = Car{
                plate: String::from("TX G023"),
                // copy remianing values from c1
                ..c1
            };
